My capstone project submission for the "Python for Beginners" program provided by EntryLevel.
Project Title: The Free Lexicon
Project URL: https://replit.com/@aaynzeddicus/The-Free-Lexicon#main.py
Project Desription: The Free Lexicon is a simple Python program designed to fetch the meaning of words in the English language. The application uses the Free Dictionary API to get the part of speech and the definition of words in English language. The program can be used by anyone who wants to look up the meanings of words in a dictionary, such as teachers, student, second-language speakers, etc.
